<p>Tired of headaches with passwords? Ready for a future where online authentication is both faster and more secure? Then mark your calendars for Passkeys Week, 
  <b>November 18-22</b>! Passkeys are an easier and more secure alternative to passwords, and are increasingly becoming the industry standard. Google is proud to support passkeys across Chrome, Android and beyond.
</p>


<p>Part of our Spotlight Weeks series, this is your opportunity to dive deep into the world of passkeys – the revolutionary technology poised to replace passwords for good. Whether you&#39;re an Android or web developer, a security researcher, or just curious about the future of online identity, this week has something for you.</p>


<p>
  <b>What are passkeys?</b> They&#39;re a new type of credential that are far more secure than passwords and much easier to use. Imagine logging in with your device lock you already have set up, such as a fingerprint scan or a face scan, instead of typing out a complex string of characters. No password is used or stored on a server that could be compromised, keeping you safe from phishing attacks. And since there&#39;s no password, there&#39; s no arcane string of characters to remember. That&#39;s the power of passkeys.
