      Each component must have a template; the html inside is what is inlined and rendered at each callsite.
      The attributes passed to the component are available as fields on dot, e.g.
      - static attributes:
      {{.static}}
      == static-value
      - mixed attributes: concatenated using print:
      {{.mixed}}
      == foo-value-of-a-bar
      - dynamic attributes:
      {{.dynamic}}
      == value-of-a
  
      In addition, the name of the caller
      {{.caller}}
      as well as slots slots from the call site are available.
      Slots are avaiable as both variables and elements:
      - Both named slots:
      slots.a:
      {{with $dot}}
        content of
        <b>

        value of parent a:
        {{.a}}
        == value-of-a
      {{end}}
      - And the rest:
      slots.rest:

        <div>
          remaining content of
